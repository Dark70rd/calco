## ü§ù Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

### We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Any contributions you make will be under the GPL V3.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL V3.0 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Dark70rd/calco/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Dark70rd/calco/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

A great bug report doesn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment.

### Use a Consistent Coding Style

We're using [Dart's style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style). It's recommended you run `dartfmt` before submitting a pull request.

### License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
